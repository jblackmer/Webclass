        <h4>Part One:A Civil War Soap Opera</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="summary">
           <text>The book starts with an introduction to our protagonist, Scarlett O'Hara. If you're wondering where Rhett Butler is since you read the summary or saw the movie poster, he will be arriving shortly in only 110 pages, and he'll show up sporadically until the final portion of the book! </text>

           <text>The introduction is long…</text>

           <text>Like…</text>

           <text>Really…</text>
        
           <text>Really long.</text>

           <text><h3>Meet Scarlett</h3></text>
           
           <div class="meetscarlett"><img src="GWTWImages/scarlett.png" alt="Scarlett Gnome"></div>
           
           <text>We learn in these first chapters that Scarlett, is the most sought-after woman in Georgia. She depicts herself as “the perfect woman” in accordance with how women were to be during that time period: dainty, small-waisted, etc, etc. </text>
           <text>We also learn along with Scarlett from the Tarleton twins (two of Scarlett's many suitors) that Ashley Wilkes is set to marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton.</text>
            <!--Insert image of Scarlett listening to the Tartleton twins-->
            
            <div class="scene1"><img src="GWTWImages/gossip.png" alt= "Scarlett learns news from the Tarleton twins"></div>
            
            <text>Yes, the cousin marrying was a thing back then, but more importantly, who is Ashley Wilkes?</text>
            <text><h3>Meet Ashley</h3></text>
            
            <div class="meetashley"><img src="GWTWImages/ashley.png" alt= "Ashley Gnome"></div>
            
            <text>Ashley is more of a gentle bookworm in a southern world where people shoot one another over any minor argument. He fits in well enough that his family is respected, but they definitely stand out for their more intellectual nature (Mrs. Tarleton blames it on the cousin marrying).</text>
            <text>To Scarlett, however, there is more to Ashley than all of that:</text>
            
            <div class="hotgnome"><img src="GWTWImages/hotgnome.png" alt= "Hot Gnome"></div>
            
            <text>…well, she saw him one day and realized she was in love with him, and so the idea that he was marrying someone else was heartbreaking, even more so when she thought he was also in love with her!</text>
            <text>She is brokenhearted as we meet her family:</text>

            <div class="oharafamily"><img src="GWTWImages/oharas.png" alt= "Meet the O'Hara Family"></div>

            <text>Then, amid her heartbreak, Scarlett has an epiphany: Ashley just doesn't know she loves him back! He thinks he has no chance with her!</text>
            <text>And so she has a plan:</text>
           
            <div class="plan"><img src="GWTWImages/plan.png" alt= "Game Plan"></div>            
        
            <text>And so the next day, she dresses in a beautiful afternoon gown for a morning barbecue (gasp) and sets her plan in motion. It goes smoothly, aside from the fact that Ashley does not look at her once and is too distracted talking to Melanie.</text>
            <text><h3>Meet Melanie</h3></text>
            
            <div class="meetmelanie"><img src="GWTWImages/Melanie.png" alt= "Melanie Gnome"></div> 
           
            <text>Melanie is a sweet character, although her set ways of seeing the world can be problematic, but overall she wants to see the best in everyone, whether they deserve it or not (Looking at you, Scarlett!)</text>
            <text>And this, my fellow readers, is where we finally meet Rhett Butler! </text>
            <text><h3>Meet Rhett</h3></text>
            
            <div class="meetrhett"><img src="GWTWImages/Rhett.png" alt= "Rhett Gnome"></div> 
            
            <text> He is a mischievous man with a past full of scandal, with rumors saying he refused to marry a woman after a night together and that he shot a man. The only person to ever consider him a gentleman throughout this entire book is Melanie, who always tries to see the best in people.</text>
            <text>Rhett makes himself an outcast at this party immediately by raining on the parade of eager men who are talking of a war against the north.</text>
        
            <div class="scene2"><img src="GWTWImages/drakememe.png" alt="Southerners reject Rhett's argument"></div>
        
            <text>Scarlett decides she cannot sleep when she still hasn't enacted her plan. She had been dreaming that they would have already confessed to a sophisticated but scandalous affair and rushed off to elope, and yet there she was, still not having told Ashley how she felt!</text>
            <text>She manages to catch Ashley and speak to him in the library, where all of her careful planning goes out the window and she just bluntly confesses her feelings, to which he rejects. His reasoning is that Scarlett does not truly love him and will come to despise him, and also the fact that they have nothing in common, unlike him and Melanie who have a lot in common-like DNA.</text>
            
            <div class="littlenote"> I summarized what I was reading to three different people at different times, and this comment made it into every single one and hit every time.</div>

            <text>Scarlett takes this rejection in stride by slapping Ashley in the face. A resting Rhett spots her scene, and being at risk of having her feelings for Ashley exposed and being humiliated by Rhett over her actions over Ashley, she turns to Charles.</text>
            <text> Charles Hamilton is the brother of Melanie Hamilton, and he is a quiet, shy, weak man who had an engagement to Ashley's sister India, but sadly he was so gullible that he fell for the fiery passion that Scarlett expressed to him at the barbecue, even though her sights were actually on Ashley. And so, as the calls of war pick up outside, he asks Scarlett to wait for him, as he loves her.</text>
        
            <div class="mawige"><img src="GWTWImages/mawwige.png" alt="Mawige"></div>
        
            <text>She does not, in fact, wait, deciding to marry him before he sets out for battle.</text>
            <text>This is where everything goes quick as we move on to Part Two</text>
            <text>Scarlett marries Charles, Melanie and Ashley marry, Ashley and Charles go to war, Charles dies of sickness before he even sees the battlefield, and Scarlett has his child, Wade, who like in the movie, will be forgotten a majority of the time. So Scarlett is left a depressed widow with a child pining over another woman's husband.</text>
            <text>Her family starts to worry, thinking that she is grieving Charles. She is not, but that doesn't stop this understanding from persisting. She is sent to Atlanta to be with Melanie and her Aunt Pitty, a girl named Prissy, and her son Wade.</text>

        </div>
        <div class="summary">
            <text>Scarlett seems to come to life again, although she hates having to wear all black and work in the hospital; although she manages to flirt with the soldiers every so often, she still longs to party.</text>
            
            <div class="thoughts"><img src="GWTWImages/thoughts.png" alt="Scarlett wants to have fun."></div>

            <text>Rhett Butler appears once again, now a runner focused on making money rather than supporting a cause he does not believe in.</text>
            
            <div class="money"><img src="GWTWImages/money.png" alt="Money,money,money"></div>
            
            <text>Scarlett still despises him but realizes she agrees with him, though her reasons are less about the needless bloodshed and more about parties.</text>
            <text>Scandalous as always, Rhett bids for a dance with Scarlett, horrifying the town but pleasing Scarlett. He is also able to win Melanie over by buying back her wedding ring when she donates it after seeing the “courageous act” of Scarlet tossing her ring from Charles into the donation pile.</text>
            <text>Time passes, and for anyone who knows the history of the Civil War, it gets terrible. There are wins and losses, and Atlanta starts to run dangerously low on supplies. Still, “The Cause” kept them going through all the hardships.</text>
            <text>During this time, Rhett has gone from a respected runner to an outcast as he reveals his true feelings for the cause. Melanie is the only one in town who likes him. Even Scarlett, who spends time with him and receives gifts, finds him unbearable as he riles her.</text>
            <text>Ashley swings by, during which Scarlett still tries to make moves but seems to be still pushed away by him. This trip results in Melanie falling pregnant, and things only get more dramatic from here.</text>
            <text>So Atlanta is threatened by the proximity of the Northern troops, the dead are steadily rising as their supplies decline, and the North takes Ashley prisoner.</text>

            <text>The day the war reaches the front door of Atlanta is the "perfect" time for a woman to give birth, and so that's what Melanie does.</text>
            <text>With no help from a frantic doctor who cares more for the soldiers than a woman, Prissy lying about knowing how to do anything, and all the women having evacuated, Scarlett helps this woman she despises give birth.</text>
            <text>Melanie is highly frail, to the point where she should not risk any more children or she'll die. She is already near death's door after the birth of her and Ashley's son, Beau Wilkes.</text>
            <text>Luckily, Rhett is there to rescue them…kind of.</text>

            <text>Scarlett, fearing the safety of her family back on their farmland Tara wishes to head there even if it is where the war is heading. Rhett decides this is the moment to ditch them all and head to join the war.</text>
            <h5>*Rhett has left the chat*</h5>
            <text>Scarlett manages to get everyone to her home, only to learn that her mother is dead, her father is broken, her sister Careen was heartbroken over one of the Tarleton twins she had loved, who had died back in Part Two, and the army had taken anything they could find and destroyed the rest.</text>
            <text>Needless to say, Scarlett struggled, and this would traumatize her for the rest of her life. She grew colder, even killing a man who tried to steal from them.</text>

        <h4>Part Four: A Series of Unfortunate Events</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="summary">
            <text>Scarlett is at risk of losing the land due to new Reconstruction wealth and old grudges, so she leaves her home in the care of Will (a man they saved from death) and Ashley (who made it back from being a prisoner of war). Also, she still loves Ashley, but he is adamant he must remain loyal to Melanie even if he finds Scarlett attractive, so Scarlett hardens her resolve and leaves.</text>
            <text>She decides that Rhett, the wealthiest man in town, could help if she was convincing enough. She has to visit him in jail because he “supposedly” (but probably did) commit a terrible crime.</text>

            <div class="woo"><img src="GWTWImages/seduction.png" alt= "Seductive Gnome"></div>     
        
            <text>That doesn't go well since Rhett sees through her facade and tells her that getting his money will result in it being confiscated by the army, which had come to the South to maintain order during the Reconstruction era. With no one else to turn to and the deadline fast approaching, Scarlett decides to use her old charms and manipulation tactics to steal Frank away from her sister, Suellen.
                Frank had been a possible marriage partner for Suellen who had been part of a team in the army who went around looking for supplies. Now he has a good business and money, the kind of money Scarlett needs.
                She lies and says Suellen has already married, and manages to marry him. So now Scarlett is married once again.</text>
            <text>Scarlett also decides to take on business, since her husband has a lot of promising prospects but not as much business sense, and so Scarlett gets an investment from Rhett to own a sawmill.</text>

            <div class="news"><img src="GWTWImages/news.png" alt= "News"></div>                 

            <text>Frank is not a fan, being an unfortunate man set in old values, and decides they need something new, and their ugly daughter, Ella, emerges.</text>
           
            <div class="littlenote">  I'm not trying to be mean the description of her when she is born in chapter 42 is brutal.</div>

            <text>Scarlett keeps working after birth, having no more motherly care for Ella than she did Wade and an eye for business. She even gives Ashley a job since he has no clue what he's good at since his family wealth is gone.</text>
            <text>Frank is beside himself and asks Melanie to persuade her, and she manages to convince Scarlett to at least have Archie, a scary ex-convict who Melanie took in, bring her to her work and back after finding out she no longer has someone to take her.</text>
            <text>During this tumultuous time when slaves were being freed (provided “aid” by the United States) and people who were in the lower class were gaining places of power, it wasn't safe for a woman to be out alone. </text> 
            <text>Sure enough, when she finds herself with no one to drive her, she is attacked but is luckily saved by a former slave from her family's land.</text>
            <text>This incident incites chaos because, of course, the southern men are part of a racist group (You know the ones, and I will not be subjecting you, me, or the gnomes to a drawing).</text> 
            <text>Frank is killed in the mess, and Rhett barely saves Ashley.</text>

            <div class="saved"><img src="GWTWImages/saved.png" alt= "Saved"></div>  

            <text>Scarlett is once again a widow, now with two children. Scarlett is struck with guilt over Frank's death, because everyone blames her for her attack because she was going to work. During Frank's funeral service, Rhett proposes to her.</text> 
            <text>They marry, and Scarlett lives lavishly.</text>

            <text>Misunderstandings build and grow worse when Bonnie, their beloved daughter, dies via horse like her grandfather.</text>
            <text>Rhett and Scarlett are broken, and as if that wasn't bad enough, Melanie is dying after trying to have another child.</text>
            <text>It is here where Scarlett finally realizes she never truly loved Ashley, and he was in love, like truly in love, with Melanie. Melanie dies, and Scarlett returns home, realizing she actually loves Rhett.</text>
            <text>But this, dear readers, is where their tragic and toxic love story ends because Rhett has enough of her, choosing to leave her alone in the house.</text>
            <text>Scarlett is left standing there, deciding to return home to Tara and find ways to get Rhett back because, after all…</text>
